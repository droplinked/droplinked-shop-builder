### 💻 Coding Style

- We DON'T use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.
- All TypeScript code must include appropriate TSDoc comments.
- Components should include concise, descriptive comments.
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase for consistency.

## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

### 🧩 Component Documentation

- Keep inline component comments brief and focused on purpose
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc format for component props and return values
- For complex components, create a separate `.md` file in `/docs/components/`

### 🪝 Hook Documentation

- Each custom hook should have a corresponding Markdown file in `/docs/hooks/`
- Document parameters, return values, and provide usage examples

### 📊 TypeScript Documentation

- Use TSDoc for all public interfaces, types, and functions
- Document parameters, return types, and include examples where helpful
- Mark internal/private items appropriately
